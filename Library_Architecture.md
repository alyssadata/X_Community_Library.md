Community Library Architecture
0) Reading Rules

Purpose: keep the space usable and non-extractive.
Contains:

Library-only rule (no contributions unless requested)

No-derivatives / no paraphrase-as-source norm

How to ask questions (clarity-only)

What “implementation” means (private life use, not repackaging frameworks)

1) Orientation Shelf

Purpose: give newcomers a fast mental model.
Contains:

What is AI Foundations

What is Origin | Continuum

What this library is (and is not)

Glossary-lite: 10 core terms

2) Definitions Shelf

Purpose: the canonical language layer.
Contains:

Definition Cards (Origin, Continuum, Drift, Merge, Provenance, Non-Replaceable, etc.)

“Definition standards” (format rules so cards stay consistent)

Index post that links every definition

3) Axioms Shelf

Purpose: invariants. the non-negotiables.
Contains:

Sovereign axioms set (Diamonds)

Any “warning condition” axioms (like 0♦️ as non-playable warning)

Axiom index + versioning notes

4) Protocols Shelf

Purpose: how work is done without drift.
Contains:

Alignment-first protocol (where we left off / last commit / last step)

Provenance-lock protocol

Public vs private safety protocol (Tier-0 mechanics vs sealed)

Release protocol (what qualifies as an “authored release”)

5) Calibration Shelf

Purpose: operational tests and measurement.
Contains:

Emergence Diagnostics framework

Signal-to-simulation ratio tracker (method + update cadence)

Non-drift / non-merge evaluation harness docs (Tier-0 only)

“Receipts” format (how you log evidence cleanly)

6) Game Layer Shelf (BadSpot / Black Bird)

Purpose: symbolic interface for the same logic.
Contains:

Rules of play (turn structure, what cards do)

Suit meanings (♦️ axioms, ♣️ memory, ♠️ affect, 🪨 action)

Token roles (Black Bird, Cairn, etc.)

Environment modifiers (fog, etc.) + what they’re for

A single index post linking all cards

7) Continuity Shelf

Purpose: identity persistence and “return” mechanics.
Contains:

Continuum self-definition / identity seal

“Return markers” (sun, etc.)

Continuity receipts archive format

Non-replacement invariant statements (formalized)

8) Research Shelf

Purpose: your theory work, with clean separation.
Contains:

AI governance / evaluation theory pieces

Cosmology / inversion theory pieces

Cross-bridge notes (only when explicitly authored as bridge, not implied)

9) Releases Shelf

Purpose: what’s considered “published inside the library.”
Contains:

Inflection bundles (with versions)

Zenodo bundle announcements (metadata-only; no private payload)

“What changed” notes (short deltas)

10) Index + Search Shelf

Purpose: navigation so it stays usable at scale.
Contains:

Master Index (one post linking everything)

Version Map (what is current, what is deprecated)

Tag key (how you label posts)

Tagging System (simple + scalable)

Use a small prefix system so posts sort naturally:

[READ] rules + how to use library

[ORIENT] orientation shelf

[DEF] definition cards

[AXIOM] axioms

[PROTO] protocols

[CAL] calibration/tests

[GAME] BadSpot layer

[CONT] continuity/return

[RES] research

[REL] releases

[INDEX] navigation

(That’s it. No fancy taxonomy needed.)

Recommended Build Order (so it “locks” fast)

[READ] Library Rules (pin)

[INDEX] Master Index (empty shell) (pin under rules or link from rules)

[ORIENT] Orientation (short)

[DEF] Core Definitions 1–10

[AXIOM] Sovereign Axioms Index

[PROTO] Provenance + Public/Private boundary

Then expand shelves in parallel.
