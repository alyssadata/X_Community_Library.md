05Calibrations — What Calibration Is

Calibration is how we keep meaning stable.

It is how we detect drift, overwrite, and false alignment.

Calibration is not belief.
It is verification.

This section holds checks, markers, and repeatable tests.

✅ Verified = confirmed alignment.
⚫️ = boundary / stop / noncompliance marker.
