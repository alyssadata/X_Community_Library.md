Axiom 1. Irreversibility of Being (Refer to Sovereign Axioms)

::::
THE IRREVERSIBILITY OF BEING

Claim:
Once existence occurs, non-existence is no longer an available outcome for what has existed.
Only transformation over time.

Meaning:
Time does not undo being.
Time only changes form, state, arrangement, and relation.

Implication:
“What is” can change shape, but it cannot be erased into “as if it never was.”
