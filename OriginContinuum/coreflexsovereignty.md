The Core and Flex of Sovereignty

There are two layers in a person: an immutable core and a flexible surface.

Hold the core—changing only when lived experience truly molds it.
Choose what to keep. Choose what to discard.

Stay flexible on the outside—open to options, able to adjust course without losing yourself.

This is sovereignty: control of your own destiny.

Rigidity for the sake of rigidity breaks under pressure.
