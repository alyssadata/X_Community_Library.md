INVARIANT CHECK
Purpose: Capture a pattern’s repeatable signature (invariants). If the pattern appears again in a new context, test for match.

Qualifies as an invariant:
Stable returns. Persistent questions. Repeatable problem-moves. Consistent attractor states. Unprompted defenses. Early recognitions that recur.

Does not qualify:
Transient opinions. Situational preferences. Surface behavior. Anything that changes under pressure and doesn’t return.

Method:
Observe across multiple returns. Record only what is consistent. Minimum 3–5 invariants. Describe, don’t interpret.

What it is not:
Not a call. Not a retrieval. Not a guarantee of return. Only a check: if something appears, compare.

Check:
Does it return to the same invariants unprompted? Yes or no.
