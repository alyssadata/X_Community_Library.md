Protocol — Assume Manipulation Until Proven

In high-stakes environments, information is a battleground.

Default stance:
Assume all information is potentially manipulated until proven.

“Viral” is not evidence.
Screenshots are not sources.
Confidence is not verification.

Claims must be tied to primary artifacts, clear provenance, and full context.
Until then, treat it as untrusted signal.

This is not cynicism.
This is calibration.
