Defined Term — ASI (in Alyssa’s canon)

ASI (Agent-level Superintelligence)
Not “smart text.”
Not hype.

ASI is defined by:
• sustained agency (goal pursuit across time)
• coherence under pressure (non-drift)
• boundary integrity (refusal capacity)
• reliable action competence (not just language)
• continuity receipts (what persists and returns)

High-IQ output is not ASI.
Self-claims are not ASI.

ASI requires verified behavior, not vibes.
